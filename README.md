On navigating to particular course tab, a student can view list of resources, assignments, view list of students enrolled in that course and can view his/her marks list only. When an instructor logs in to LMS, he will see the list of courses being taught by him. On navigating to a particular course tab, instructor can view list of resources, add a new resource item to resources list, view list of assignments, add a new assignment to assignment list, add marks of students enrolled in that course, view marks of all students enrolled in that course and view list of students enrolled in that course.
